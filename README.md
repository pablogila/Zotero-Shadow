# Zotero Shadow
A dark theme for the Zotero reference manager, with the exception of the PDF viewer, for easier reading. This is a continuation of the Zotero Dark Theme by [Dominic-DallOsto](https://github.com/Dominic-DallOsto/Zotero-Dark-Theme) and [Rosmaninho](https://github.com/Rosmaninho/Zotero-Dark-Theme).  

Zotero Shadow is intended for Windows. It may run on Linux, although it is not supported and may display minor glitches. For Linux, it is recommended to use the Zotero Flatpak version, which already includes a dark mode.

## Contribution
I used and loved Zotero Shadow in my Windows days. Now that I've switched to Linux, I no longer need it, so I haven't touched the code since. But if you think the code is worth improving, please do not hesitate to git-merge if you think it will benefit everyone: D
